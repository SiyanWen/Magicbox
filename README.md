- This is a table-based post website(that's why it's called Magic box).

- After Logging in, you can create, edit and delete posts.

- We support 2 type of posts: plain text and code.

- If you select code, we will render the syntax highlight with Highlight.js.

- If you select plain text, we will just display the raw input. With [Mathjax](https://www.mathjax.org/#gettingstarted), you can write math equations in your posts.

- Enjoy!
